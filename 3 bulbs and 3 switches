There is a room and in which we have three bulbs. And their switches are outside the room connected to bulbs. And all the bulbs are in working state.
There is a door inside the room which you can open only ones. So how will you check which button is for which bulb.
Ans?






































Suppose swicthes be X, Y, Z. Switch on the button x for 5-10 minutes. And than switch of. And then switch on the y button. So the bulb which is very little light
or which is hot is connected to x. And the bulb which is glowing to connected to y. And the remaing ones connected to third one.
