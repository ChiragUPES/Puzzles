 Two trains are on same track and they are coming toward each other. The speed of the first train is 50 km/h and the speed of the second train is 70 km/h. 
 A bee starts flying between the trains when the distance between two trains is 100 km. The bee first flies from first train to second train. Once it reaches 
 the second train, it immediately flies back to the first train â€¦ and so on until trains collide. Calculate the total distance travelled by the bee. Speed of 
 bee is 80 km/h.

 Ans: Two trains are coming towards each other. So, The speed will be the sum of the speed of train1+train2. Therefore Speed= 70+50=120km/h.
      Distance bw train is 100km.
      So, D=S*T
      Total time takne by the train is: 100/120=(5/6).
      Talking about the distance covered by bee: 80*(5/6)=66.67 approx Km.
