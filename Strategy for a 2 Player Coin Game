Consider a two players.PlayerA and PlayerB. There is a row of even number of coins. and player can pick the coin from any of the two corner of rows. The player
that collects more value win the game.DEvelop the startergy such that for the player so that making the first turn i.e. PlayerA such that he never looses the game.

Example:
Row of coins->    18  20  15  30  10  14
Statergy that not work. Is that if we take the maximum of two corners . As player A chooses maximim of two corner. ie 18 (between 18 and 14)
                                                                           player B chooses-> 20 (between 20 and 14)
                                                                           player A chooses-> 15 (between 15 and 14)
                                                                           player B chooses-> 30
                                                                           player A chooses-> 14
                                                                           player B chooses-> 10
                                                                           sum of player A->18+15+14=47
                                                                           sum of player B-> 20+30+10=60
                                                                           Player A looses.
This stratergy did not work.
Talking about the next stratergy-> The idea is to count all the values of even coins and all the values of odd coins.We compare the odd values with the even values.
The value which is maximum let's say value even is maximum. So, player A chooses the even value  and we force player b to choose only odd values. In this way we can 
win the playerA.
Example->   0   1   2   3   4    5
            18  20  15  30  10  14
            Value at odd-> 20+30+14=64
            Value at even-> 18+15+10=43
            Player A select odd value and we forced player B to choose only even value.
            18  20  15  30  10  14
       Turn Player A-> can select index value of 0 or 5.So player A selects 14
            18  20  15  30  10
            Player B-> selects only values that is on even index. either 18 or 10. Let's say 18.
            20  15  30  10
            Player A->  selects 20.
            15  30  10
            Player B-> 15
            Player A-> 30
            Player B-> 10.
This is the stratergy.
